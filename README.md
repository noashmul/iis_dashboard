We introudce an interactive dashboard (Dash-Plotly) that takes the shape of a semi-annual report. In that report we summarize the various changes that have taken place in Hadar neighborhood.

Our main goal is to help the decision-makers to understand the current status of the neighborhood, in the fields that interest the [Hamal](https://www.hamal.tech/ "Hamal") and the municipality of Haifa, and to help them get better decisions, backed by data.

The dashboard is available:
